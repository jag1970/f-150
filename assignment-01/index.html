    <h2>The Empire Stikes Back</h2>
    <p>This is arguably the best Star Wars movie ever released to date. It is not the first but the third release of the original saga. One of the reasons it ranks as the first is because of the revelation of (Spoiler Alert) Luke Skywalkers father being the villain being known as Darth Vader. The movie also introduces Yoda, a favorite among fans.</p>
         <h2>Revenge of the Sith</h2>
         <p>The second of my favorite Star Wars movies is also the third release of a saga, however from what is mostly commonly referred to the prequel movies. This movie reveals how Anakin Skywalker, Luke’s father, became the villain known as Darth Vader. It also shows one of the longest lightsaber battles of all the movies between Darth Vader and Obi-wan Kenobi.</p>
            <h2>Rogue One</h2>
            <p>This movie is likely the last of the best Star Wars movies ever made. It stays true to the feeling of what a real Star Wars movie should be. It’s a great story about what happened prior to the original from 1977. Because of its popularity, it spawned a TV show called Andor which is equally great if not better.</p>
                <h2>A New Hope</h2>
                <p>Some would argue that this is the best Star Wars movie ever made. It introduces the main characters of the series and is a real adventure with the ultimate destruction of the Death Star in the final moments.  Many became instant fans when watching for the first time. Interesting note, this is also known as episode 4 or IV in the series. The creator, George Lucas, determined this was the best area to start the movies.</p>
                    <h2>Return of the Jedi</h2>
                    <p>Where Revenge of the Sith shows Anakin Skywalkers fall from grace, Return of the Jedi shows his redemption. This movie shows a classic battle between father and son but in the end family wins.  This is one of my favorites because it showed the internal conflict to do what was right.</p>
