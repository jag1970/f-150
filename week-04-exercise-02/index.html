                    Asakusa is a small district in Tokyo, Japan. It was on of the first locations we visited when
                    we first arrived in Tokyo. Our Hotel was nearby and when we first arrived it was dark however, when we first set out 
                    the following morning, this is one of the first pictures I took. It is a popular area for shopping with 
                    the famous temple Senso-ji nearby and tons of shopping. You will also notice Tokyo Skytree in the background.

                    The Toyko Skytree is one of two towers that embrace the Tokyo skyline. The other being the Tokyo Tower which is older.  It is a very popular
                    tourist destination and is right next to a major shopping mall. In the forefront is the Asahi Beer Hall. Asahi is probably the most common
                    made beers in Japan. You will also notice an odd golden structure that is also nicknamed "Golden Turd" for obvious reason.

                    It is also a popular tourist destination that you can take a taxi boat type ride down. We actually did this and witnessed many beautiful
                    sites. At the end of the boat ride, we hike to the other tower in Japan so be basically travel from one tower to the other by boat.
