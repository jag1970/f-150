        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="./devtools-vandalism-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" />
        </div>
        <h2>What I "Vandalized"</h2>
        <p>
            I edited a CNN webpage about the current government shutdown and the affect on
            flights:
        <ul>
            <li>The text I edited was the Superman offered to help fly people</li>
            <li>CNN primarly uses red but I changed to blue and gray. Also changed
                font,
            </li>
            <li>It was funny to me to be able to changed the headline</li>
            <li>Some colors didnt work intially so I only made sublte changes to make it appear real</li>
            <li>I chose this because it is a major issue and wanted to make it funny</li>
            <li>I was able to understand more about HTML CSS style sheets but it did take awhile to find where to actually edit the data.</li>
            <li>I think I have a better sense of designing websites but know there is a ton more to learn</li>
        </ul>
